  <h1>Was Henry Vl really a bad king?</h1>
  <u><h1>Introducing to Henry Vl</h1></u>
  <p>Henry VI (6 December 1421 – 21 May 1471) was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom#English_monarchy">King of England</a> from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471,and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_claims_to_the_French_throne">disputed</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_French_monarchs">King of France</a> from 1422 to 1453. The only child of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V_of_England">Henry V</a>, he succeeded the English throne at the age of nine months upon his father's death, and succeeded to the French throne on the death of his maternal grandfather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VI_of_France">Charles VI</a>, shortly afterwards.</p>

  <p>Henry inherited the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), in which his uncle Charles VII contested his claim to the French throne. He is the only English monarch to have been also crowned King of France, in 1431. His early reign, when several people were ruling for him, saw the pinnacle of English power in France, but subsequent military, diplomatic, and economic problems had seriously endangered the English cause by the time Henry was declared fit to rule in 1437. He found his realm in a difficult position, faced with setbacks in France and divisions among the nobility at home.</p>
  
  <p>Around Christmas Day 1454, King Henry regained his senses. Disaffected nobles who had grown in power during Henry's reign, most importantly the Earls of Warwick and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Neville,_5th_Earl_of_Salisbury">Salisbury</a>, took matters into their own hands. They backed the claims of the rival <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_York">House of York</a>, first to the control of government, and then to the throne itself (from 1460), pointing to York's better descent from Edward III. It was agreed that York would become Henry's successor, despite York being older. In 1457, Henry created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Wales_and_the_Marches">Council of Wales and the Marches</a> for his son <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_of_Westminster,_Prince_of_Wales">Prince Edward</a>, and in 1458, he attempted to unite the warring factions by staging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveday_(1458)">The Love Day</a> in London.</p>
  
  <p>Despite such attempts at reconciliation, tensions between the houses of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lancaster">Lancaster</a> and York eventually broke out in open war. Their forces engaged at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Northampton_(1460)">Battle of Northampton</a>, 10 July 1460, where the king was captured and taken into captivity under the Yorkists. Queen Margaret, who also had been on the field, managed to escape with her son, the prince, fleeing through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales">Wales</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Scotland">Scotland</a> where she found refuge in the court of the queen regent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Guelders">Mary of Guelders</a>, recent widow of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_Scotland">James II</a>. Here she set about eliciting support for her husband from that kingdom.</p>
  
<p>Re-entering England at the end of the year, the English queen in force engaged with the Duke of York at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wakefield">Battle of Wakefield</a>, 30 December 1460, where York fell. A few weeks later, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_of_St_Albans">Second Battle of St Albans</a>, 17 February 1461, her forces engaged with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Neville,_16th_Earl_of_Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>, under whose custody her husband was being held. She defeated Warwick and liberated the king. Henry's mental state at the time was such that he had reputedly laughed and sung as the battle raged around him.</p>

<p>The victory however was short-lived. Within six weeks, the king and queen's forces were once more defeated at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Towton">Battle of Towton</a>, 29 March 1461, by the Duke of York's son, Edward. Henry and Margaret together evaded capture by Edward, and this time they both escaped into exile in Scotland. With Scottish aid, Margaret now travelled to the continent to elicit further support for her husband's cause.</p>

<p>Mainly under her leadership, Lancastrian resistance continued in the north of England during the first period of Edward IV's reign, but met with little luck on the field. At the same time as Henry's cause was beginning to look increasingly desperate in military terms, an English embassy to Scotland, through the Earl of Warwick on behalf of Edward, served to further weaken his interests at the Scottish Court in political terms. After the queen mother's death in November 1463, Scotland now actively sued for peace with England and the exiled king passed back across the border to try his fortune with those nobles in the north of England and Wales who were still loyal.</p>

<p>Following defeat in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hexham">Battle of Hexham</a>, 15 May 1464, Henry, as a fugitive in his own land, continued to be afforded safety in various Lancastrian houses across the north of England. While he was in hiding at Waddington Hall, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waddington,_Lancashire">Waddington, Lancashire</a>, the home of Sir Richard Tempest, he was betrayed by "a black monk of Addington" and on 13 July 1464, a party of Yorkist men, including Sir Richard's brother John, entered the house for his arrest. Henry fled into nearby woods, but was soon captured at Brungerley Hippings (stepping stones) over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Ribble">River Ribble</a>. He was subsequently held captive in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>The following poem has long been attributed to Henry, allegedly having been written during his imprisonment. However, a largely identical verse appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Baldwin_(author)">William Baldwin's</a> 1559 work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mirror_for_Magistrates">The Mirror for Magistrates</a>, a collection of poems written from the perspective of historical figures.</p>
